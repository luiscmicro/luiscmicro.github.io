This protocol is based on [Invitrogen Dynabeads Magnetic Beads](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/product-brand/dynal/dynabeads-technology.html?s_kwcid=AL!3652!3!616918262534!e!!g!!dynabeads&ef_id=CjwKCAiAk--dBhABEiwAchIwkZxsTeGl69NJz679-c9T3Q7Xyip4OKMP6apODlLt1xTdprsD3O-aERoCxbMQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!3!616918262534!e!!g!!dynabeads!15928445201!138055918205&cid=bid_sap_cep_r01_co_cp1362_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_gaw_bt_pur_con&gclid=CjwKCAiAk--dBhABEiwAchIwkZxsTeGl69NJz679-c9T3Q7Xyip4OKMP6apODlLt1xTdprsD3O-aERoCxbMQAvD_BwE) for protein purification.
We determined that the best media to grow S. coelicolor in liquid is YEME, but it is easy to contaminate because of its high Sucrose content. All the glassware used needs to be washed carefully and autoclaved before using.


## Growing Streptomyces coelicolor
  1. Wash and autoclave 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks
  2. Add 100 mL of YEME media
  3. Inoculate with 100 uL of spore stocks
  4. Grow for atleast 72 hours at 30 C in the incubator with heavy shaking
  
## Harvest and Lyse Cells using French Press
  1. Transfer 100 mL of cell culture into a 500 mL Centrifuge container.
  2. Centrifuge at 8000 rpm on the JA-14 rotor for 30 minutes.
  3. Discard the supernatant.
  4. Weight about 1.5 grams of dry cell pellet and Transfer to a 50 mL falcon tube.
  5. Add 3 mL of lysis Buffer for a 2mL/gram solution 
  6. Transfer the cell solution to the French Press and press at 1260
  7. Repeat atleast two times.
  
## After Lysis

We recommend preparing your sample containing the histidine-tagged protein in a total volume of **1000 μL 1X Binding/Wash Buffer**. 

  1. Thoroughly resuspend the Dynabeads magnetic beads in the vial (vortex >30 sec or tilt and rotate 5 min).
  2. Transfer 50 μL (2 mg) Dynabeads™ magnetic beads to a microcentrifuge tube. 
  3. Place the tube on a magnet for 2 min. Aspirate and discard the supernatant. 
  4. Add **700 μL** of lysed sample (prepared in 1X Binding/Wash Buffer) to beads. Mix well. 
  5. Incubate on a roller for **5 min** at room temperature (or colder if the protein is unstable at room temperature). The incubation time may be increased up to 10 min. 
  6. Place the tube on the magnet for 2 min, then discard the supernatant. 
  7. Wash the beads **4 times with 300 μL 1X Binding/Wash Buffer** by placing the tube on a magnet for 2 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the beads thoroughly between each washing step.
  8. If the protein is to be eluted, proceed to step 7. To use bead/protein complexes in other applications, resuspend the bead/protein complex in a suitable volume of 1X Pull-down Buffer (or other buffer compatible with your downstream application). If you wish to continue with Pull-down, continue to step 1 in “Protein pull-down” (see page 2). 
  9. Add **750 μL His-Elution Buffer**. Incubate the suspension on a roller for 5 min at room temperature (or colder if the protein is unstable at room temperature). 
  10. Apply on the magnet for 2 min and transfer the supernatant containing the eluted histidine-tagged protein to a clean tube. 
  
Current work is focused on improving quality of extraction by adding imidazole to washing steps.
