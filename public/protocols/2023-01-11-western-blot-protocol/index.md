# Western Blot Protocol


<!--more-->

This protocol is adapted from the BioRad User Protocol TB446 Rev.Â A 0905 for their SDS-PAGE Strep-Tag II Fusion products. The protocol is for the transfer and detection of proteins on PVDF and nitrocellulose membranes. However, different membranes might have different blocking conditions.

## Buffer preparation

The following buffer preparations are required for one small blot. You might need to prepare larger volumes.

1.  Prepare 300 mL 1x PBS (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7).
2.  Prepare 25 mL blocking solution (5% BSA, 0.5% TWEEN-20 in 1x PBS).
3.  Prepare 150 mL PBST (0.1% v/v TWEEN-20 in 1x PBS).
4.  Prepare 1 L of Running Buffer by diluting the 10x Tris/Glycine/SDS solution to 1x (Final 1x concentration of Running Buffer is).
5.  Prepare Western Transfer Buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Trisbase, 20% methanol, pH 8.0)

## Protocol

1.  Run 10 uL samples on SDS-Page gel (we use miniProtean TGX). Voltage is best at constant 195 V for about 1hr. You need to have New Running Buffer for better results. Y
2.  Electrophoretically transfer proteins to nitrocellulose. Our device supports quick transfer for 3minutes per gel, but best results are achieved doing a 10 minute transfer.

3.  Wash emmbrane 2 times, each for 10 minutes with 15 mL 1x PBS.
4.  Incubate membrane in 20 mL blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C with gentle agitation.
    Blocking overnight may give a better signal-to-noise ratio.
5.  Wash membrane 3 times, each for 5 minutes, with 20 mL PBST.
6.  Prepare Primary Antibody solution by doing a 1:4000 dilution of His Antibody in PBST.
7.  Add 10 mL diluted Primary antibody solution and incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation.
8.  Wash membrane in PBST 2 times for 10 minutes each with 20 mL PBST.
9.  Prepare HRP Conjugate Antibody solution by doing a 1:3000 dilution of His Antibody in PBST.
10. Add 10 mL diluted HRP Conjugate antibody solution and incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation.
11. Wash membrane 2 times, each for 10 minutes with 20 mL PBST.
12. Wash membrane 2 times, each for 10 minutes with 20 mL PBS.

## Visualizing Blot membrane

1.  Drain the membrane by touching the corner of a dry paper towel in a 45 degree angle.
2.  Place the membrane on the clean tray cover.
3.  Prepare SuperSignal HRP Substrate by mixing 1 mL of 2x Luminol/Enhancer and 1 mL of 2x Stable Peroxide Solution.
4.  Wet the entire surface with SuperSignal HRP Substrate quickly . Incubate the blot in the substrate for 2 minutes.
5.  Remove membrane from substrate and drain excess membrane by touching paper towel.
6.  Place membrane in plastic development folder to remove any bubbles.
7.  Use the Chemi high sensitivity setting on the Visualizer camera.
