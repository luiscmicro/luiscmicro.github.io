Techniques like MALDI IMS offer insights into the production of antibiotics during interspecies interactions. By mapping the spatial distribution of metabolites directly on microbial colonies, these approaches reveal how physical proximity and competition influence specialized metabolism. Such tools help uncover the ecological roles of antibioticsâ€”not just as therapeutic agents, but as molecular signals involved in microbial communication, defense, and niche establishment.
