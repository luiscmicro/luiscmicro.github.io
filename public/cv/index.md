# Professional Experience

### Traxler Lab, UC Berkeley — *PhD Researcher* (2019–Present)

- Led cross-disciplinary project across 500+ microbial genomes integrating comparative genomics, protein modeling, and functional assays.
- Developed bioinformatics pipelines for ortholog detection, phylogenetics, and AlphaFold modeling.
- Built co-evolutionary modeling tools in R/Python to predict protein-protein interactions.
- Validated predictions through functional biochemical assays.
- Executed RNA prep, transcriptomics, and strain engineering to map regulatory networks.
- Delivered insights into conserved bacterial signaling relevant to drug discovery and synthetic biology.

### Mota-Bravo Lab, UC Irvine — *Undergraduate Researcher* (2016–2019)

- Built software for automated plasmid assembly and functional annotation.
- Isolated and sequenced novel plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes from >600 isolates.
- Investigated mobile genetic elements mediating siderophore-antibiotic gene co-localization.

### Logan Lab, King’s College London — *Undergraduate Researcher* (Summer 2017)

- Studied Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient in chick limb development via in situ hybridization.
- Identified Smoc1 as a Shh-responsive gene.

### United States Marine Corps — *Sergeant, Supply Chief* (2011–2014)

- Managed largest supply account in MAG–Afghanistan: 2,826 items worth $44.9M.
- Designed recovery program for retrograde of 930 PEIs ($9.1M).
- Provided advanced supply/logistics training to SNCOs and officers.
