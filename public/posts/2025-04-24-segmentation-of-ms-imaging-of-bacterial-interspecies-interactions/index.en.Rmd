Unsupervised analysis of bacterial interspecies interactions using MALDI-IMS and the Cardinal package in R.
<!-- more -->
## 1. Introduction

Understanding how bacteria modify their chemistry in response to nearby species is key to decoding interspecies interactions. In this post, we showcase an unsupervised analysis workflow for MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) experiments aimed at uncovering spatial patterns of metabolite production during interspecies interactions of Actinomycetota. Using the Cardinal R package, we segment ion images without prior assumptions, allowing us to detect regions of chemical differentiation that emerge during microbial co-culture. Briefly, our setup involves growing spatially arranged patches of Amycolaptosis AA4 and Streptomyces coelicolor on solid medium, followed by sample preparation for high-resolution MALDI-IMS.

## 2. Growing cells and preparing samples

The following procedure was used to prepare samples for MALDI-IMS analysis:

- Media preparation: ISP2 medium was poured into 10 cm Petri dishes to a thickness of approximately 3 mm.
- Spore placement:
  - 0.5 µL of Amycolaptosis AA4 spore stock was spotted onto the agar.
  - 2 mm away, 0.5 µL of Streptomyces coelicolor spore stock was placed to allow interaction.
  - An additional 0.5 µL patch of S. coelicolor was placed 2 cm to the right of the interacting pair to serve as a non-interacting control.
- Incubation: Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days.
- Sample preparation: A square of agar containing the interaction region was excised and placed onto a MALDI target plate.
- Drying: The agar samples on the target plate were dried at 30 °C for 5 minutes.
- Matrix application: Matrix was deposited via sublimation following Rita's method.

## 3. Unsupervised Segmentation

We collect the sample using MALDI-IMS module on a Thermo-Fisher orbitrap. 

First, we load .imzML files and plot a known ion. Even without preprocessing, we can detect known molecules by m/z—for example, amychelin, a siderophore produced by Amycolaptosis AA4.

However, raw ion images are noisy and make spatial interpretation difficult.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Cardinal)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
wt_aa4_path1 <- "msdata/040922_wt-aa4-2mm-1.imzml"
wt_aa4_1 <- readMSIData(wt_aa4_path1,resolution = 100, units="ppm",mass.range=c(150,1500))
image(wt_aa4_1, mz=761.3,tolerance=50, units="ppm",smooth="gaussian", enhance="histogram")
```

### 3.1 Pre-processing

We then normalize across pixels using total ion current (TIC) so that we can compare peaks across pixels. Then we can filter for high-quality peaks using peak processing: we use a subsample (30% of the spectra) of the dataset to create reference peaks and set a signal to noise ratio (SNR=3) to identify peaks, then we filter the lowest frequent filters (filterFeq=0.02).

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
wt_aa4_1 <- summarizeFeatures(wt_aa4_1, c(Mean="mean"))
wt_aa4_peaks <- wt_aa4_1 |>
  normalize(method="tic") |>
  peakProcess(method="diff",SNR=3, sampleSize=0.3,filterFreq=0.02)
```

### 3.2 Visualization

Let’s re-plot amychelin before and after processing.
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
amychelin_before<- image(wt_aa4_1, mz=761.3,smooth="gaussian", enhance="histogram")
amychelin_after <- image(wt_aa4_peaks, mz=761.3,smooth="gaussian", enhance="histogram")
matter::as_facets(list(amychelin_before, amychelin_after), nrow=2,
    labels=c("Before procesing", "After processing"))
```
We can see that we've sucesfully reduced noise in the image and we can now see spatially distinct regions where molecules are being produced.

### 3.3 Clustering and segmentation

We use `spatialShrunkenCentroids()` to perform unsupervised segmentation of spatially variable features.

**Key parameters:**

- `weights`: spatial weighting method ("gaussian" or "adaptive")
- `r`: neighborhood radius
- `k`: max number of clusters (some may be dropped)
- `s`: sparsity parameter; higher values result in fewer selected peaks

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
wt_aa4_ssc <- spatialShrunkenCentroids(wt_aa4_peaks,
    weights="gaussian", r=3, k=8, s=2^(1:4))
```

Let’s examine the results.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  kable(wt_aa4_ssc@elementMetadata,"pipe")
```


We can visualize the results and pick one that has low sparcity and the correct number of clusters that is biologically relevant.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
image(wt_aa4_ssc, i=1:4)
```

We choose the second result as it we can still see clearly each colony and the surrounding areas are distinct. 
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
wt_aa4_ssc1 <- wt_aa4_ssc[[2]]
image(wt_aa4_ssc1, type="class")
```

Here we can start making some interpretations of the five discrete regions in this model:
  1. *Amycolaptosis AA4* during interactions with *S. coelicolor*
  2. *S. coelicolor* during interactions with *Amycolaptosis AA4*
  3. *S. coelicolor* alone
  4.  Media (around *S. coelicolor*)
  5. Media (around *S. coelicolor* during interactions)
  6. Noise
  7. Media (around *Amycolaptosis AA4*)
  8. Noise
  
Let’s compare segments of interest 1, 2, and 3.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
plot(wt_aa4_ssc1, type="centers", linewidth=2, select=c(1,2,3), superpose=FALSE, layout=c(1,3))
```

It is difficult to discern which peaks change based on ssc segmentation by looking at the whole spectra, so we must plot the t-statistics.

#### Plotting and interpretting t-statistics of the m/z values

The t-statistics compare segment-specific centroids to the global mean:

- Positive = enriched in that segment  
- Negative = depleted in that segment



```{r warning=FALSE,message=TRUE}
plot(wt_aa4_ssc1, type="statistic", linewidth=2,
    select=c(1,2,3), superpose=FALSE, layout=c(1,3))
```

We can now see that there are peaks that are distinct in each region. In particular, if we compare segment 2 and segment 3. Segment 2 is the patch with *S. coelicolor* during the interaction and it has more peaks than when it's grown alone but also at a higher statistical difference.

Let’s visualize the top m/z features from each of the segments we are interested.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
wt_aa4_ssc_top <- topFeatures(wt_aa4_ssc1)
     
image(wt_aa4_peaks, mz=c(head(subset(wt_aa4_ssc_top, class==1)$mz, n=1),
                         head(subset(wt_aa4_ssc_top, class==2)$mz, n=1),
                         head(subset(wt_aa4_ssc_top, class==3)$mz, n=1)), smooth="gaussian", enhance="histogram",layout=c(3,1))
```


Clearly we see peaks that are unique to *Amycolaptosis AA4* and peaks that are present in *S. coelicolor* during interactions or alone. More importantly we detect these peaks in an unsupervised manner.
