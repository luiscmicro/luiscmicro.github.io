Introduction Understanding how bacteria modify their chemistry in response to nearby species is key to decoding interspecies interactions. In this post, we showcase an unsupervised analysis workflow for MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) experiments aimed at uncovering spatial patterns of metabolite production during interspecies interactions of Actinomycetota. Using the Cardinal R package, we segment ion images without prior assumptions, allowing us to detect regions of chemical differentiation that emerge during microbial co-culture. Briefly, our setup involves growing spatially arranged patches of Amycolaptosis AA4 and Streptomyces coelicolor on solid medium, followed by sample preparation for high-resolution MALDI-IMS.

Growing cells and preparing samples The following procedure was used to prepare samples for MALDI-IMS analysis: Media preparation: ISP2 medium was poured into 10 cm Petri dishes to a thickness of approximately 3 mm.

An additional 0.5 µL patch of S. coelicolor was placed 2 cm to the right of the interacting pair to serve as a non-interacting control. Incubation: Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Sample preparation: A square of agar containing the interaction region was excised and placed onto a MALDI target plate.

Conclusions Unsupervised segmentation of MALDI-IMS data using the Cardinal package reveals clear spatial differentiation in metabolite production during interspecies interactions. We detect distinct ion peaks that are unique to Amycolaptosis AA4, as well as peaks that appear in Streptomyces coelicolor when growing alone versus during interaction. Importantly, these patterns were identified without prior knowledge of specific m/z features, highlighting the power of unsupervised methods for exploratory analysis. The spatial shrunken centroid approach not only identifies spatially enriched ions, but also associates them with specific biological regions. The t-statistic analysis shows that the region corresponding to interacting S. coelicolor exhibits more metabolite peaks than the non-interacting region, suggesting a metabolic response to the presence of AA4. Together, this workflow provides a robust framework for dissecting the spatial logic of microbial chemical interactions.

Solvent extraction: A chemical method used to isolate small molecules by mixing biological samples with solvents (e.g., methanol, ethyl acetate) that dissolve specific classes of compounds. Secondary metabolites: Bioactive small molecules produced by microbes, often during stationary phase, which can include antibiotics, pigments, or signaling compounds. Protocol for Solvent Extractions Add the plugs to 750 µL of solvent (methanol and ethyl acetate are most commonly used) in an Eppendorf tube. Vortex, sonicate for 10 minutes, and let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours). Vortex again and transfer the solvent to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. SpeedVac to evaporate all solvent: ~15 min for EtOAc ~45 min for MeOH ~1 hour for water ⚠️ Use the lowest vacuum level for ethyl acetate (EtOAc), as it’s very volatile. Check the chart next to the SpeedVac. Re-suspend the pellet in 500 µL methanol + reserpine (10 or 100 ng/mL). 10 ng/mL is usually enough 100 ng/mL gives a more robust peak, but may interfere with co-eluting compounds For water extractions, use 50:50 methanol:water. Vortex, sonicate for 5 min, then vortex again. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. Using solvent-safe pipette tips, transfer supernatant to LCMS vial, leaving ~50 µL behind to avoid disturbing the pellet. Inspect visually for any floating particles. If particles are present, transfer to a new Eppendorf tube and repeat steps 7–8. Ensure it’s particle-free before submitting to LCMS.

Some labs wash Eppendorf tubes before extractions to remove contaminants. We don’t, as long as extraction controls are included: Solvent-only control Sterile media control For small extractions (3–4 plugs), use 500 µL solvent, and re-suspend in 100 µL. Use vial inserts for LCMS. Reserpine is not required, but helpful to confirm LCMS injection success.

Instead, they inhabit complex, multispecies communities where interactions between neighbors determine survival, access to resources, and ecological success. These interactions—whether antagonistic, cooperative, or neutral—are the foundation of microbial ecology. From nutrient sharing and metabolic cross-feeding to chemical warfare and spatial competition, microbes engage in a rich spectrum of behaviors that reflect the evolutionary pressures of life in dense, dynamic environments. My research is motivated by the idea that understanding these microbial interactions can reveal the rules of microbial life that govern natural systems, as well as inform the design of synthetic communities or therapeutic interventions. In particular, I’m fascinated by the role of specialized metabolites—antibiotics, siderophores, and signaling molecules—as mediators of interaction. These compounds often reflect an evolutionary arms race, but they can also coordinate multicellular behaviors or enable interspecies symbioses. By dissecting the molecular basis of these interactions, we can better understand how microbes structure their environments and influence broader ecological or clinical outcomes. Focusing on microbial interactions also brings a systems-level perspective to microbiology. Rather than studying a single microbe in isolation, it invites us to ask how genetic programs, regulatory networks, and biochemical capabilities are modulated by the presence of others. For me, this view has reshaped how I think about microbial function—not just in terms of individual fitness, but as part of a broader network of exchange, competition, and adaptation.
