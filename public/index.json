Instead, they inhabit complex, multispecies communities where interactions between neighbors determine survival, access to resources, and ecological success. These interactions‚Äîwhether antagonistic, cooperative, or neutral‚Äîare the foundation of microbial ecology. From nutrient sharing and metabolic cross-feeding to chemical warfare and spatial competition, microbes engage in a rich spectrum of behaviors that reflect the evolutionary pressures of life in dense, dynamic environments. My research is motivated by the idea that understanding these microbial interactions can reveal the rules of microbial life that govern natural systems, as well as inform the design of synthetic communities or therapeutic interventions. In particular, I‚Äôm fascinated by the role of specialized metabolites‚Äîantibiotics, siderophores, and signaling molecules‚Äîas mediators of interaction. These compounds often reflect an evolutionary arms race, but they can also coordinate multicellular behaviors or enable interspecies symbioses. By dissecting the molecular basis of these interactions, we can better understand how microbes structure their environments and influence broader ecological or clinical outcomes. Focusing on microbial interactions also brings a systems-level perspective to microbiology. Rather than studying a single microbe in isolation, it invites us to ask how genetic programs, regulatory networks, and biochemical capabilities are modulated by the presence of others. For me, this view has reshaped how I think about microbial function‚Äînot just in terms of individual fitness, but as part of a broader network of exchange, competition, and adaptation.

Our device supports TURBO transfer for 3 minutes per gel, but best results are achieved on our custom protocol of 25V limit, 2.5A constant and 7 minute transfer for 1 gel or 14 minutes for two gels. Monitor the current/voltage on the transferring device. You need to have at least 10 minutes of 0.5 A with a limit of 25V. If the current is too low, you should increase the time to ensure complete transfer of the proteins. Similarly, if the current is higher than 0.5 you should decrease the time of transfer to 7 minutes or as little as 3 minutes depending on the current. Wash emmbrane 2 times, each for 10 minutes with 15 mL 1x PBS. Tip about membrane size Before you transfer the membrane to the washing tray, cut the membrane to the size of the PAGE gel using a blade. This is to ensure you fit the membrane in the small tray and save some antibody since the volumes are smaller. Incubate membrane in the remaining 20 mL blocking solution for 2.5 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C with gentle agitation. Blocking overnight may give a better signal-to-noise ratio. Wash membrane 3 times, each for 5 minutes, with 15 mL PBST. Prepare Primary Antibody solution adding 3.75 uL of His Antibody in 15 mL PBST (1:4000 dilution).
