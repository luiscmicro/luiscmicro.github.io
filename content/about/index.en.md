My research explores how microbes produce antibiotics during interspecies interactions, with a focus on the enzymatic and genetic foundations of specialized metabolite biosynthesis. I focus on filamentous Actinomycetota, which have evolved complex regulatory networks and biosynthetic strategies to produce diverse bioactive molecules during competitive interactions. By integrating genome mining, comparative genomics, and structural bioinformatics with biochemical assays, I aim to identify and characterize novel biosynthetic pathways and the enzymes that drive them. This work contributes to the broader goal of antibiotic discovery and offers insight into the ecological roles of specialized metabolites in microbial communities.
