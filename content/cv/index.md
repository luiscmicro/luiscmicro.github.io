# Professional Experience

### Traxler Lab, UC Berkeley --- *PhD Researcher* (2019--Present)

- Developed computational pipelines integrating AlphaFold2 modeling and coevolutionary analysis to predict protein-protein interactions across 480+ bacterial genomes.
- Designed structural variants of a novel four-Component signaling system using coevolution-guided mutagenesis; identified residues critical for autophosphorylation.
- Collaborated with wet-lab teammates to prioritize variants and interpret results.
- Validated predictions using ATPase activity assays, phostag gels, and FPLC-purified recombinant proteins.
- Maintained shared codebases and documentation to support lab-wide use of modeling tools.
- Co-authored peer-reviewed publications and contributed to open science initiatives, including figure generation and tool sharing.

### Mota-Bravo Lab, UC Irvine --- *Undergraduate Researcher* (2016--2019)

-   Built software for automated plasmid assembly and functional annotation.
-   Isolated and sequenced >600 environmental isolates to study mobile antibiotic resistance genes.

### Logan Lab, King's College London --- *Undergraduate Researcher* (Summer 2017)

-   Studied Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient in chick limb development via in situ hybridization.
-   Identified Smoc1 as a Shh-responsive gene.

### United States Marine Corps --- *Sergeant, Supply Chief* (2011--2014)

-   Managed largest supply account in MAG--Afghanistan: 2,826 items worth \$44.9M.
-   Collaborated with logistics team to design and implement a recovery program for the retrograde of 930 PEIs (\$9.1M), improving accountability and turnaround.
-   Provided advanced supply/logistics training to SNCOs and officers.
